## E-Auction - an online trading post 

This is a project created as a learning tool to learn about the development process, from design to implementation, of an online web application which interacts with a relational database. E-auction is essentially a prototype for an auction/trading system similar to ebay.

### Main Tools Used
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - used for the backend, event-driven and non-blocking, good for concurrent requests (like a bunch of people bidding at the same time)
- [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) - used for user authentication
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) - a node.js MVC web application framework used to get our app easily started
- [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/) - provides an easy access to MySQL, and a simple ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper)
- [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org) - a JavaScript MVC framework, used to make our HTML files more dynamic 
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - mobile first front-end framework, used to easily and quickly build the look of the site
